        r"""Return density estimator that approximates the distribution $p(\theta|x)$.

        Args:
            num_atoms: Number of atoms to use for classification.
            training_batch_size: Training batch size.
            learning_rate: Learning rate for Adam optimizer.
            validation_fraction: The fraction of data to use for validation.
            stop_after_epochs: The number of epochs to wait for improvement on the
                validation set before terminating training.
            max_num_epochs: Maximum number of epochs to run. If reached, we stop
                training even when the validation loss is still decreasing. Otherwise,
                we train until validation loss increases (see also `stop_after_epochs`).
            clip_max_norm: Value at which to clip the total gradient norm in order to
                prevent exploding gradients. Use None for no clipping.
            calibration_kernel: A function to calibrate the loss with respect to the
                simulations `x`. See Lueckmann, GonÃ§alves et al., NeurIPS 2017.
            resume_training: Can be used in case training time is limited, e.g. on a
                cluster. If `True`, the split between train and validation set, the
                optimizer, the number of epochs, and the best validation log-prob will
                be restored from the last time `.train()` was called.
            force_first_round_loss: If `True`, train with maximum likelihood,
                i.e., potentially ignoring the correction for using a proposal
                distribution different from the prior.
            discard_prior_samples: Whether to discard samples simulated in round 1, i.e.
                from the prior. Training may be sped up by ignoring such less targeted
                samples.
            use_combined_loss: Whether to train the neural net also on prior samples
                using maximum likelihood in addition to training it on all samples using
                atomic loss. The extra MLE loss helps prevent density leaking with
                bounded priors.
            retrain_from_scratch: Whether to retrain the conditional density
                estimator for the posterior from scratch each round.
            show_train_summary: Whether to print the number of epochs and validation
                loss and leakage after the training.
            dataloader_kwargs: Additional or updated kwargs to be passed to the training
                and validation dataloaders (like, e.g., a collate_fn)

        Returns:
            Density estimator that approximates the distribution $p(\theta|x)$.
